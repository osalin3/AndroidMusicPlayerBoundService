# AndroidMusicPlayerBoundService
Excerpt from an Android Music player client that used an interface exposed to a bound service

A bound service was written which provided an API via an AIDL that supported music player functionality such as play, pause, resume, and stop. An client app provided an activity that exposed the bound serviceâ€™s functionality to the user.
